Wrong side of the tracks: Rails on Ubuntu

Sure its not a Mac, but Ubuntu does Rails too!
This is a setup script to get a complete working Ruby on Rails development environment up and working fast. Ubuntu changes far to often to spend a lot of time setting up your development environment. This script is my attempt to solve that issue for myself. Since I maintain some older Rails apps that development environment needs to support  many versions of Rails.
What gets installed?

Netbeans
Ruby 1.8.7
MySQL 5.0
Rails 3 Beta
Git
A whack of common gems and their dependancies.

At the moment this setup works well for the type of work I am doing and may work for you as well. If you have preferences for other things edit the script as necessary.
Its been tested on a default install of Ubuntu Karmic 9.10 and Lucid Lynx Beta 2.

How to use it:

Run it like any other script:
Make sure you add execute permissions to it and then run it. Since it is installing stuff you will definitely need to use sudo to run it.

mike@ubuntu:~$ chmod +x wrong_side
mike@ubuntu:~$ sudo ./wrong_side
